{"name":"Imsathon","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to IMSAthon\r\n\r\n![IMSA Logo](https://www.imsa.edu/sites/default/files/upload/IMSALogoNameBlueSmall.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Essentials\r\nWhen: April 10th 5 - 9 PM and April 11th 9 AM - 6 PM   \r\nWhere: IMSA B-Wing (meet in the lecture hall)   \r\nLimiting sign ups to 72 people!\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is a Hackathon?\r\nHackathons provide a venue for self-expression and creativity through technology. People with technical and non-technical backgrounds come together, form teams around a problem or idea, and collaboratively create a unique solution from scratch — these generally take shape in the form of websites, mobile apps, and real, 3D products.\r\n\r\n## What tools can we use?\r\nSince we are in B-wing, we will have the Maker Space open for use during the entire event!  Any students that would like to model their product using 3D printing or a 3D pen can work in the beautiful space.  While extra points will be awarded to teams that create a final design that is a physical product, any coding language may be used for any type of product, including mobile applications and websites.\r\n\r\n## Registration\r\nIf this sounds like your type of fun, sign up here:   \r\nYou will be able to officially name teams on April 10th, so recruit your friends to sign up with you!\r\n\r\n## Mentors\r\n### Ben Hamilton\r\n* Engineer at Facebook\r\n* Mobile (iOS and Android) software development\r\n* Internationalization\r\n* Testability  \r\n\r\n### Michael McCool\r\n* Software Engineer working on user experience design and implementation\r\n* Experience in Video Games\r\n* Experience running own company and leading large teams\r\n* Interested in Business and Web Development\r\n\r\n### Summer Wu    \r\n* Experienced in Web Development\r\n* Took a Gap Year to intern in Silicon Valley\r\n* Yale Class of 2018\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\n### April 10th\r\n5:00 PM - Doors Open to Lecture Hall\r\n\r\n5:30 PM - Opening Remarks \r\n\r\n6:00 PM - Workshops    \r\n* Product Development (Location)\r\n* Web Development (Location)\r\n* Public Speaking/ Pitching your Idea (Location)\r\n* CAD for 3D Printing (Location)\r\n\r\n7:00 PM - Form Teams    \r\n* Pizza\r\n* Speedteaming (For those without a team)\r\n\r\n### April 11th\r\n\r\n9:00 AM - Check up on teams in the Lecture Hall\r\n\r\n10:00 AM - Feedback from Mentors Starts\r\n\r\n10:45 AM to 12:45 PM - Lunch in Sodexo\r\n\r\n3:00 PM - 4:00 PM - Presentation Workshop\r\n\r\n5:00 PM - Building Ends/ Presentation Begins\r\n\r\n6:00 PM - Prize Announcement / Closing remarks\r\n\r\n## Prizes\r\n\r\n$50 dollar Gift Cards for First Prize   \r\n$30 dollar Gift Cards for Second Prize   \r\n$20 dollar Gift Cards for Third Prize   \r\n$15 dollar Gift Cards for two Pure Choice winners (not the previous three winners)   \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n**Who can participate?**\r\n\r\nMost of our events are long so we don’t recommend signing up to participate unless you can make the commitment for the team you are on; you’re welcome to grab a ticket just to check it out. We welcome the type of person that is curious, is ready to make mistakes and likes to solve problems because it’s fun. \r\n\r\n**Do I have to know how to code? What skills am I expected to have?**\r\n\r\nCoding is only one tool that you can use for solving problems. The best projects we’ve seen have come from the most talent diverse teams, teams who decided to take on a challenge that required them to learn a new skill set or merge disciplinary approaches. Expected Skills: Willingness to fail and get back up, passion for creation and an unquenchable desire to learn. \r\n\r\n**Why “MonkeyBars”?**\r\n\r\nThe playground is a place to have fun, make mistakes and meet friends. That is what we want our events to embody. Outside of that…it just sounded good at the time.\r\n\r\n**Do Hackathons actually produce anything worthwhile?**\r\n\r\nHackathons, like any good tool, have a few great use cases and plenty of poor ones. Getting a large group of people together for a cause has natural social benefits but, as we've seen with political movements, it takes a well thought out strategy to create meaningful, tangible outcomes. Many groups misuse hackathons leaving hackathon goers and companies a like disenchanted. Our goal is to bring a purposeful approach to hackathons and focus on the value for those in attendance. \r\n\r\n**Why should I participate?**\r\n\r\nTo learn new skills. To meet other doers/makers/creators. To connect with pros in industry. To try out an idea. To play with gadgets. To win cool stuff. \r\n\r\n## Additional Resources to Prepare\r\nhttp://appsembler.com/blog/10-tips-for-hackathon-success/\r\n\r\n## Any Questions or Concerns?\r\nDirect them to Zach Yager at zyager@imsa.edu or by Facebook messaging me.
